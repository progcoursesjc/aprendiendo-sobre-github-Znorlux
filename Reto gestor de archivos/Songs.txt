For a master of deception and subterfuge You've made yourself quite the bed to lie in Do your time traveling through the tanning booth So you don't let the sun catch you crying So predictable, I know what you're thinking My teeth are beating and my knees are weak It's as if there's something up with the wiring You can poke your head behind the mountain peak Don't have to mean that you've gone into hiding So predictable, I know what you're thinking I'm watching your every move I feel the tears are coming on It won't be long, it won't be long Straight from the cover shoot Still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face And I'm keeping on my costume (keeping on) I'm calling it a writing tool And if you're thinking of me, I'm probably thinking of you There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face So predictable, I know what you're thinking Ooh, ha Yeah Yeah, ah == Don't get emotional, that ain't like you Yesterday's still leaking through the roof That's nothing new I know I promised this is what I wouldn't do Somehow giving it the old romantic fool Seems to better suit the mood So if you wanna walk me to the car You oughta know I'll have a heavy heart So can we please be absolutely sure That there's a mirrorball? You're getting cynical and that won't do I'd throw the rose tint back on the exploded view Darling, if I were you And how's that insatiable appetite? For the moment when you look them in the eyes And say, "Baby, it's been nice" So do you wanna walk me to the car? I'm sure to have a heavy heart So can we please be absolutely sure That there's a mirrorball for me? La, ohh Oh, there'd better be a mirrorball for me == Take it from the top If I start I just can't stop All the patience that I've got It's not enough to save me It's a race against the clock But we don't wanna watch Keep running 'til we're lost Got me thinkin' Pull it out of park, put it in drive I can feel your heart beatin' with mine Underneath the stars lookin' for a sign Glowing in the dark 'til the sun shines Made it pretty far on the first try Might've set the bar a little too high Started with a spark, now we're on fire Started with a spark Ooh, baby You take me on a ride Gonna drive me crazy Ooh, baby I feel like we made it pretty far Now we're stargazing Push until it pops Tryna clear my thoughts Better keep the A/C on for me Not enough, yeah Windows start to fog Clothing coming off Making it too hot Got me thinkin' Pull it out of park, put it in drive I can feel your heart beatin' with mine Underneath the stars lookin' for a sign Glowing in the dark 'til the sun shines Made it pretty far on our first try Might've set the bar a little too high Yeah, started with a spark, now we're on fire Ooh, baby You take me on a ride Gonna drive me crazy Ooh, baby I feel like we made it pretty far Now we're stargazing
